formatting with placeholders:
    
   I/P --> print("I'm going to inject %s text here and %s text here" %('some','more'))
   O/P --> I'm going to inject some text here and more text here
   
   %s converts to string
   %d converts number to integer (without rounding)
   
   print('I wrote %s pages today, %3.75) --> replaces %s to 3.75
   print(I wrote %d pagestoday, %3.75) ==> replaces %d to 3
