•	JSON is a data exchange format similar to XML
•	JSON is a lightweight format compared to XML
•	JSON = Java Script Object Notation
•	Python uses JSON module to handle read/write to JSON object
Write Data to JSON
    Import json
    book = {} ------ dictionary object
    book[‘heli’] = {‘name’: heli, ‘address’: ‘5 Humphrey Street, NY’, ‘phone’: 394358323}
    s = json.dumps(book)  ----s is JSON string object
    with open(“filepath:, “w”) as f:
        f.write(s)   ---write JSON string to file
•	You can now read this JSON data using any language that supports JSON such as Javascript, C++ etc.
•	Hence, this is called data exchange format (i.e. exchanging data from python program to Javascript program)
Read JSON file
    Import json
    f = open(“filepath”, “r”)
    s = f.read()   --- s is JSON String
    book = json.loads(s) ---book is dictionary object
